This Java-based project demonstrates advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM) concepts by incorporating Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), LDAP-based authentication, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Using Spring Boot and Spring Security, the application integrates JWT-based SSO with refresh tokens to enhance session security, and implements email-based OTP for MFA using Googleâ€™s TOTP library. It also features in-memory LDAP directory integration to simulate enterprise-level user authentication. The RBAC system dynamically assigns and verifies permissions based on user roles, ensuring granular control over user actions. This project offers a comprehensive overview of IAM practices and security mechanisms, showcasing real-world implementations of critical authentication and authorization concepts in a Spring Boot environment.
